**Description:**  
Silverleaf is a **slender, fern-like plant** with pale, silvery-white leaves that **catch even the faintest light**, seeming to glow softly in shadow. The leaves are cool to the touch and shimmer faintly when exposed to magic or moonlight. The plant rarely grows below eye level, often found clinging to **rock faces, ruins, or the trunks of ancient trees**.

It is most commonly found in regions affected by **old magic or ley disturbance**, often in places where time or memory feels slightly... off.

**Uses:**

- Ground into a fine paste, Silverleaf is used in **memory potions** and **clarity tonics**. It heightens awareness, restores lost thoughts, and can even break minor enchantments.
    
- Used in rituals to **commune with ancestors or spirits**, especially those tied to place or lineage.
    
- When burned, it produces a **scentless smoke** that can reveal **invisible glyphs** or illusions.

**Handling Notes:**

- Harvest during twilight or dusk; full daylight causes the leaves to **become brittle** and lose potency.
    
- Never dry completely, Silverleaf must be used fresh or **preserved in distilled moonwater**.
    
- Dangerous to overdose: excessive use can cause **temporal dissonance** (seeing moments out of order) or short-term identity confusion.
