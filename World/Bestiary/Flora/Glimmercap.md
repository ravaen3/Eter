**Description:**  
Glimmercaps are delicate, pale-blue mushrooms known for their **soft, cold luminescence**, which pulses faintly in moonlight or when exposed to magical residue. Each cap is no larger than a child's palm, with a thin, glassy stem that shimmers faintly when disturbed.

Often found in **clusters near rotting stumps or buried leyline threads**, Glimmercaps are prized by alchemists, healers, and night-scouts alike.

**Handling Notes:**

- Must be harvested at night, preferably under a waning moon, or its **potency fades**.

- Some creatures (notably **Dreamwasps** and **Fellbite Spiders**) are drawn to their scent and glow.
