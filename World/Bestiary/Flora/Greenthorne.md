**Description:**  
Greenthorn is a hardy, dark-stemmed shrub with thick, waxy leaves and clusters of long, emerald-colored thorns that glint faintly when wet. The plant exudes a **strong, minty aroma**, especially after rain, and grows in dense thickets that can deter wildlife—or conceal it.

It thrives in regions recently exposed to **burn, blood, or disruption**, earning it the nickname **“battlebloom”** among old border-wardens.

**Handling Notes:**

- Harvest with **gloved hands**, as the thorns secrete a numbing oil that causes **temporary skin stiffness**.
    
- The best cuttings are taken at **dawn**, when the plant’s oils are most concentrated.
    
- Avoid overharvesting, Greenthorne regrows slowly and **overused patches attract carrion-feeding insects**.
