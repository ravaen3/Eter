## Description

Serene is the ethereal goddess of the moon and guardian of night’s quiet grace. Born from the union of light and tide, she brings balance to the darkness and guides the hidden rhythms of Eter’s skies. Her gentle silver light calms restless souls and illuminates paths when the sun has set.

She is a goddess of subtlety and secrets — nurturing yet cunning. Serene’s influence extends beyond mere illumination; she governs dreams, the passage of time in shadow, and the delicate dance between fate and free will. Though serene in name, her wisdom conceals a sharp mind and a will capable of profound influence.

## Appearance

Serene is often depicted as a tall, graceful elf cloaked in shimmering silver robes that flow like moonlight on water. Her hair cascades like liquid light, studded with tiny stars that sparkle and fade. Her eyes glow softly with a pale radiance, reflecting the calm of the night sky.

To mortals, she may appear as a glowing figure walking upon waves or as a silver stag gliding silently through a midnight forest. At times, her visage is glimpsed in the serene glow of the moon itself, inspiring awe and quiet contemplation.

## Worship
Serene is mainly worshipped by the elves, her original descendants, the Moon Elves have built great shrines in her honour.

Serene’s worshipers gather most fervently during the full moon, when her light is strongest and her presence most keenly felt. Temples and shrines dedicated to her often sit atop high hills, in mountains or near bodies of water, places where moonlight can be fully embraced.

Her followers include sailors who navigate by her glow, poets seeking inspiration in her quiet grace, and mystics who delve into dreams and visions. Rituals to Serene involve offerings of silver coins, moonflowers, and quiet night vigils.

Believers honor her as a guide through darkness—both literal and metaphorical—and as a protector of those who walk paths unseen by day.
