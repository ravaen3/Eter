## Description

Glimerion is the god of invention, knowledge, and forward momentum — the divine spark of progress that drives mortals to reach beyond what is and imagine what could be. Born of fire and harvest, of creation and reflection, Glimerion is a synthesis of **labor and enlightenment**, a deity who sees the world not as it was or is, but as it **might become**.

Where Darian brings strength and Celine brings rhythm, Glimerion brings **innovation**, the restless desire to shape, refine, and elevate. He is worshipped by those who build cities from stone, etch ideas onto parchment, or spark change through discovery.

He favors those who question, who strive, who dream — but is quick to turn from those who seek only power without understanding.

## Appearance

Glimerion appears as a youthful figure clad in robes of copper and parchment, their arms ink-stained and their eyes glowing like molten gold. Gears, cogs, and floating script orbit his form, constantly shifting and assembling into shapes and blueprints. His voice is calm but quick, like pages turning in a storm.

To mortals, Glimerion may manifest in dreams of sudden clarity, in the shimmer of a new invention, or in the quiet hum of a well-made machine.

## Worship

Glimerion’s worship is practical, widespread, and ever-evolving. His temples are **academies**, **workshops**, and **archives**, filled with blueprints, forges, lecture halls, and libraries. His faithful, primarily gnomes, but also extends to scribes, builders, technomancers, and thinkers who record, teach, and test.

Rituals include the unveiling of new inventions, conventions of discovery, and the first draft of a new idea. Sacrifices are symbolic: broken tools, worn books, or prototypes offered to inspire refinement.

Glimerion teaches that the world is a **draft**, never finished, and that mortals are not just shaped by gods — but can shape the world in return.
