## Description

Celine is the **goddess of sensuality, fertility, and the pleasures of the flesh**, a radiant being born from fire and mischief, whose presence is as intoxicating as ripe fruit in late summer. Her domain is the heat of skin, the blush of a first kiss, and the **bounty of fields coaxed from soil by sun and sweat**.

She is worshipped as both a lover and a life-giver — the one who kindles the spark of desire and carries it into lush fulfilment. Passion, she teaches, is not a sin but a sacred force; **to love, to hunger, to crave, and to create are holy acts** in her eyes. Her magic lies in both seduction and sowing — the body and the field are equal temples.

But beware: though she blesses generously, she is fickle. Jealousy, scorn, or repressed longing may summon her darker aspects — temptation, obsession, and the overripe decay of neglected desire.

## Appearance

Celine appears as an impossibly alluring figure: sun-kissed skin glistening like honey, hair cascading in wild curls of gold and crimson, and eyes the color of a golden harvest. Her scent is that of blooming flowers after rain, spiced wine, and sweet grain. Her form is ever-shifting — curvaceous and fertile, but never the same twice — echoing the diversity of beauty in all mortals.

She may also manifest as a glowing harvest maiden, a laughing muse in the arms of a lover, or a graceful dancer in moonlit fields, beckoning with a smile that stirs hearts and haunts dreams.

## Worship

Celine's worship is vibrant, carnal, and reverent. Her shrines are found in **flowering groves, vineyard pavilions, brothels, and bountiful farms**. Offerings include fresh fruit, wine, silks, perfumes, and songs sung in passion. Her holy days align with planting and harvest seasons, but also with weddings, births, and festivals of pleasure.

To walk in Celine’s light is to embrace the hunger for life — to plant deeply, to love wildly, and to harvest every touch of joy the world offers.
