## Description

Verion is the **god of war, blood, and legacy** — a divine contradiction born of **death and desire**, of **judgment and creation**. He does not represent chaos or slaughter for its own sake, but **war as the crucible of change**, as the reaping that leads to a new sowing. Through conquest, nations rise. Through death, glory is won. Through spilled blood, dynasties are born.

He is the god who blesses the war cry, who anoints the victorious with sacred flame, and who whispers to tyrants and liberators alike. His is the **cycle of triumph and ruin**, of **sons inheriting thrones taken by blade**, of **banners raised over fields sown with corpses**.

**Verion does not preach mercy — he teaches purpose**. To fight is to embrace one’s role in the cycle, and to fall in battle is not shameful, but sacred.

## Appearance

Verion appears as a towering figure clad in armor forged from bone, bronze, and fire. His skin is ash-gray, his eyes burn like battlefield pyres, and his voice carries like a war drum across plains. His long black hair is braided with teeth and gold, and his body bears the scars of a thousand wars.

When he rides, it is atop a great tusked beast shrouded in smoke and banners. In mortal vision or art, he may also appear as a crowned warrior soaked in blood, or a shadow on the eve of battle.

## Worship

Verion’s temples are **war camps, thrones, and pyres**. His priests — often double as generals or executioners. Offerings to him are made through **ritual combat**, **oaths of vengeance**, or **blood spilled on sacred earth**. Weapons are not left at his altars — they are **consecrated through use**.

His holy days are marked by **battle tournaments, tribal rites, and coronations won by conquest**. Worship is rarely peaceful. To pray to Verion is to **ask for strength to take what one deserves, and the fire to endure what must be lost**.

He is most revered by **orcs**, whose cultures believe that through war, they fulfill not only their destiny, but the world's. Among them, he is called **“Gor-Vash”** and his name is spoken before the first charge and after the last breath.
