Darian appears as a towering figure clad in glowing armor, molten veins coursing beneath obsidian skin. His hair blazes like wildfire, and his eyes flicker with smoldering embers. Often he carries a massive hammer or tongs, instruments of creation and destruction.

To mortals, Darian’s presence is felt in the roar of the forge, the flash of a blade, or the crackling warmth of a hearth fire. At times, he may manifest as a great phoenix or a fiery mountain erupting in molten fury.
