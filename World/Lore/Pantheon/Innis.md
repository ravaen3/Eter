## Description

Innis is the primal spark from which all existence flows. Transcending all gods, he is the single most powerful being in the cosmos. Embodying the initial flare of life and thought. Innis forged Eter from the void eternal, setting into motion the divine architects who shaped the world. Known as the source of all that is, Innis rarely intervenes directly, content to watch the unfolding tapestry of existence.


## Appearance

Innis manifests as a radiant, shifting flame without fixed form â€” a pure, brilliant light flickering softly in an endless void. Those who claim visions of Innis describe a presence both comforting and unknowable, neither harsh nor gentle, but always illuminating.


## Worship

Worship of Innis is rare and often esoteric, focused on understanding creation itself. Devotees seek enlightenment and inspiration, meditating on the primal spark within all things. Temples dedicated to Innis are minimalist, often open-air sanctuaries where seekers watch the stars and contemplate beginnings. Rituals focus around meditation, silence, and darkness. Invoking the inner soul to try and connect with creation itself.
