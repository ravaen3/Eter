## Description

Miris is the divine steward of magic — an eternal observer and silent guide of the arcane forces that thread through all of Eter. Born not of flesh nor flame, but of **mana and starlight**, he is the first and greatest of the **Wyrdbound**, gods who did not shape the world, but who **govern its deeper laws**.

Miris does not speak often, nor command devotion with thunder or fire. Instead, he is felt in the whisper of ancient tomes, the hum of a leyline beneath one’s feet, and the awe of a spell cast for the first time. His will is to preserve balance: to ensure magic serves as a tool of wonder, not a weapon of ruin.

He is neither warm nor cold, kind nor cruel — but **precise**, driven by knowledge, harmony, and the pursuit of higher truth.

## Appearance

Miris appears as a tall, androgynous figure robed in deep indigo and violet, their form seeming half-real — as though woven from spell-light and celestial patterns. Where others have eyes, Miris bears a single, ever-watching **glyph of light** upon their brow. Arcane symbols flow and shimmer across their robes, shifting subtly with the presence of nearby magic.

To mortals, Miris may appear in visions: a voice echoing in candlelight, a figure glimpsed between stars, or a pair of glowing eyes watching from the edge of a circle.

## Worship

Miris is worshipped not with noise, but with **study**, **discipline**, and **reverence for the arcane**. His temples are often **libraries**, **mage towers**, or hidden sanctums deep in forgotten ruins. His followers — known as the **Veiled Circle** — are devoted to preserving magical lore, guarding dangerous relics, and ensuring the balance of power remains intact.

Offerings to Miris often involve the inscription of new spells, the translation of ancient texts, or the sacrifice of raw mana through ritual.

To worship Miris is to devote oneself to the mysteries of reality, to pursue wisdom over impulse, and to understand that magic is not merely a force — but a language the universe uses to speak.
