## Description


Velthar is the **god of death, judgment, and the immutable laws that govern the end**. He was not born to shape the world, but to **guard its balance**, tasked by Innis to ensure that nothing — not even gods — escapes the final passage.

He is the **stillness after battle**, the **silence of the grave**, the **truth that all things must pass**. But he is not cruel — Velthar offers **structure, peace, and justice** to a world ruled by mortality. In his view, **death is not punishment — it is fulfillment.**

To mortals, Velthar represents the **final gate** — and the one who stands before it, weighing every soul. The wicked are cast down. The worthy pass on. The defiant are tested.

## Appearance

Velthar appears as a tall, solemn figure robed in black and gray, his face a shadow.  His hands, skeletal and pale, often holding a dim lantern shining a ghostly light.

In some visions, he manifests as a silent cloaked shadow, always watching from the edge of a funeral pyre or battlefield.

## Worship

Velthar is rarely worshipped with joy, but always with **respect**. His temples are built from stone and silence: **crypts, black monoliths, or places where life ended with great meaning**. His clergy — known as **Gravebinders** or **Keepers of the Gate** — tend to burial rites, weigh the dying’s last words, and **judge blood-oaths and executions** with sacred authority.

Rituals are calm and unadorned — **ashes cast to wind, coins placed upon the eyes, or names etched into black stone**. Offerings to Velthar include **oaths sworn before death**, the **truth of confession**, and **the silence kept after a funeral**.

He is invoked when a **soul must be bound**, when **justice must be final**, or when **death must be understood rather than feared**.

## Domains and Realms

Velthar rules three afterlife realms:

- **_Vael’saerin_** — a tranquil realm of honor, where the worthy dead rest in memory and still light.
    
- **_Nhar’zul_** — the abyss of the damned, where those who defied death's laws are tormented by echoes of their lives.
    
- **_The Trials_** — a place of reckoning, where unjudged souls must endure divine tests before passing on.
