## **Description**

Thuros is the god of fire and radiant sky — the divine force who first lit the world, driving away the void with flame and brilliance. He is the embodiment of celestial purpose, the relentless flame that exposes truth and sears weakness. It was by his light that the work of shaping Eter could begin.

Austere and eternal, Thuros represents divine judgment, sacred strength, and the cleansing power of the sun. He is not a gentle guide, but a trial to endure. His light is truth, and truth is often harsh.

## **Appearance**

Thuros manifests as a figure of pure sunlight and living flame, ever-shifting and immense. His form gleams like molten gold and sunsteel, with a corona that scorches the air. No features are visible — only brilliance, heat, and voice like thunder on stone.

Those who glimpse him in visions describe a burning crown on the horizon, or a single blazing eye opening above the desert sky.

## **Worship**

Worship of Thuros is strongest in the sun-scorched deserts of Eter, where his harsh light defines life and survival. There, his most devoted followers form the **Order of the Sun** — a militant ascetic cult who live in stone sanctuaries carved into cliffs and dunes. They believe that suffering under the sun is the path to purity.

The Order teaches that the sun reveals all things: lies, weakness, fear — and burns them away. Its members train in silence, meditation, and combat beneath the open sky. They take vows of truth, endurance, and service to the flame.

Rituals are held at dawn and zenith, when Thuros’ power is greatest. Flame is sacred — never extinguished without purpose. Offerings include sun-tempered steel, polished glass, and oaths spoken in firelight.
