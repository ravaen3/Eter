## Description

Gaia is the divine embodiment of life’s breath and the soul of the world itself. As one of the Three Founders, she shaped Eter’s form with care and wonder, coaxing verdant life from barren stone. She is both nurturing and unyielding — a goddess of great love and immense fury. Her presence is felt in every seed that sprouts and every quake that rends the earth.

While many see her as a motherly figure, Gaia is not merely a giver of life but its protector and punisher. She nurtures those who respect the balance, but her wrath is feared by those who defile the wilds.

## Appearance

Gaia appears as a colossal figure draped in living greenery, with hair of moss and vines, eyes like twin emerald suns, and skin of stone covered in blooming flowers and crawling roots. Her form shifts with the seasons — fertile and blooming in spring, fierce and stormy in summer, wise and waning in autumn, and still and cold in winter.

To mortals, she may also manifest in subtler forms: a radiant stag, a speaking tree, or the sudden silence before a quake.

## Worship

Worship of Gaia is widespread and ancient. Her temples are often groves, stone circles, or vast gardens. Rituals follow the natural cycles — solstices, harvests, and planting seasons — and often involve offerings of fresh crops, song, and dance. Druids, rangers, and beastkin serve as her most devout agents, preserving her will in deep forests and wild places.

Her followers believe in harmony, stewardship, and the sacred rhythm of life and death. Gaia does not demand obedience, but reverence and balance.
