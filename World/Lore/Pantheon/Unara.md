## Description

Unara is the goddess of water, motion, and feeling — the ebb and flow of all that lives and breathes. One of the Three Founders, she is the force that brings movement to form, rhythm to chaos, and depth to the divine. Where [[Gaia]] rooted life and [[Thuros]] ignited light, Unara gave existence its rhythm — from tides and rains to emotion and intuition.

She is revered as the mother of all transformation. Calm and nurturing, yet unknowable and tempestuous, Unara represents both the healing balm and the flood, both dream and drowning. Her domains include not only seas and weather, but sleep, longing, change, and prophecy.

## Appearance

Unara is often seen in visions as a tall, ethereal woman formed of moonlight and flowing water, ever-shifting and translucent. Her hair cascades like rivers, her skin ripples like mist, and her eyes glow like bioluminescent tidepools. She rarely speaks — when she does, her voice resonates like distant waves, laced with both serenity and sorrow.

In other manifestations, she appears as a great leviathan formed of silver foam, a veiled priestess walking atop the sea, or a moonlit swan gliding silently across a mirror-like lake.

## Worship

Unara is worshipped primarily by merfolk, but also along coastlines, rivers, and lakefronts, where shrines and sanctuaries float on tide-linked platforms or stand half-sunken in water. Her rites are lunar and fluid — never rigid — focusing on tides, dreams, and transformation.

Worshippers, known as Tidecallers or Moonweavers, include seers, poets, storm-priests, and healers. Rituals involve silent moonlit ceremonies, dream-interpretation, tidal offerings, and “veil rites” — water blessings said to let a mortal glimpse their true emotional depth.
