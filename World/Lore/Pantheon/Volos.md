## Description

Volos embodies the endless expanse beyond life, death, and creation — the **Eternal Void** from which all things arise and to which all things return. Born of death’s finality and the trickster’s shadow, he represents the **abyssal silence** that follows the unraveling of worlds, the space between breaths, and the quiet that holds all secrets.

He is not malevolent, but indifferent — a force of cosmic balance and the ultimate unknown. His presence inspires awe and terror alike, symbolizing the **endless cycle of existence and non-existence**. Mortals who seek to transcend flesh and spirit often invoke Volos, hoping to glimpse truths beyond the stars.

## Appearance

Volos is rarely seen in full form. When he appears, it is as a **shifting shadow** or a **dark mist** coalescing into vague humanoid shapes with **eyes like black holes**. His form seems to absorb light and sound, creating an eerie silence in his wake.

Legends say that to gaze directly upon Volos is to be lost in infinite emptiness, where time and self dissolve.

## Worship

Volos’ followers are often mystics, hermits, or cultists who reject the material world. They worship in secluded sanctuaries — caves, deep void-like pits, or darkened temples where silence reigns. Rituals involve meditation, silence, and sometimes self-sacrifice to “return” to the void.

His followers, known as the **Void-Touched**, are a cult operating in the shadows, usually in the underdeep. They practice divination, astral projection, and rites meant to peel back the layers of existence.

## Domains and Influence

Volos governs the realms of **emptiness, cosmic silence, and oblivion**. While many fear his realm as the end of all things, others see it as a place of renewal — a blank canvas from which new creation can arise.
