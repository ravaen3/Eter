### Description

**Asteria** was born in fire and iron from the scattered tribes of the Aden, unified by the legendary war-leader Asterion after decades of tribal conflict and war against orcish raiders. From its seat in **Edis**, once a fortified tribal encampment turned royal capital, Asteria rose to become a beacon of human civilization in the western heartlands.

Founded in **136**, following Asterionâ€™s formal coronation as king, Asteria represented a new order, one of law, heritage, and centralized power. The chaotic warbands of the Aden were reshaped into legions. Oral tradition was codified into written law. Tribes became provinces, ruled by noble houses sworn to the crown. The birth of Asteria marked the end of the tribal age and the beginning of the first great empire.
