### 2000 BR — The First Spark**

Before seas, skies, or stars, before gods or mortal thought, there was only the **Void Eternal**, a stillness infinite and silent. But from this nothingness flared a single spark — [**Innis**, the **Great Creator**.](Innis.md)

With boundless power, Innis formed a world from chaos — a barren stone adrift in silence, which would become **Eter**. Longing to witness a spectacle of divine beauty, Innis birthed the **Three Founders**, godly architects of wonder and balance:

- [**Thuros**, the Lightbringer](Thuros.md)
- [**Unara**, the Tideweaver](Unara.md)
- [**Gaia**, the Earth Mother](Gaia.md)

Charged with making Eter worthy of divine witness, the Founders set to work.

- Gaia breathed **life into stone**, her essence coaxing verdant forests and flowering plains from the dust.
- Unara sculpted **rivers and seas**, flooding the empty basins with tides and rain.
- Thuros bathed the land in **radiance**, igniting the sky with flame and brilliance so Innis might behold their creation.
### **1900 BR — The Children of Heaven and Stone**

After an age of shaping the world, Thuros grew lonely in the sky. With Unara’s aid, he conjured a daughter:

- **Serene**, Lady of the Moon

Graceful and radiant, Serene lit the night with her silver glow and birthed the **Stars**, her celestial kin. Yet Gaia, sensing imbalance, beguiled Thuros into creating a son:

- **Karnas**, the Stoneforged

Karnas carved mountains and heaved valleys across Eter. Gaia, in a moment of divine weakness, **infused him with her immortal spirit**, granting him resilience rivaling the gods — a decision she would come to deeply regret.
### **1800 BR — Beasts and Behemoths**

Gaia, now attuned to the deeper forces of creation, breathed life into beasts. Thus came the **First Fauna** — mighty creatures and lesser beings that roamed the wilds, some of the more notable creatures included:
- Goblins
- Giants
- Kobolds
- Firbolgs
### **1700 BR — The Rise of the First Born**

Innis, pleased by Gaia’s works, decreed the creation of a mortal race gifted with intellect and will. With Innis’ help, Gaia fashioned the **First Born** — creatures of thought and ambition. They spread swiftly, shaping the land through fire, stone, and steel.

The gods, stirred by pride and rivalry, began shaping mortal races of their own.

- **Karnas**, seeking glory, crafted the **Dwarves**, secretive and strong, hidden deep in the roots of mountains. They unearthed ores and forged the first metals.

- **Serene**, ever patient, nurtured the **Elves** upon her moon, shaping their beauty and grace before casting them gently down to Eter.
### **1600 BR — The Second Wave: The Wyrdbound**

With creation thriving and death rising, **Innis** summoned a second wave of gods — not to shape the world, but to bind its hidden forces. These were the **Wyrdbound**, divinities tied to the mystical fabric of Eter.

- **Miris, Keeper of the Arcane**  
    Born of mana and starlight, Miris watches over the flow of magic. He guides spellcasters in secret, ensuring arcane balance across the world.
    
- **Velthar, Lord of the Last Gate**  
    Forged from silence and judgment, Velthar created the realms of death:
    
    - _Vael’saerin_, resting place of the worthy
    - _Nhar’zul_, abyss of the damned
    - _The Trials_, where souls are tested
    
- **Faelune, the Trickster**  
    Shaped from dream and deception, Faelune forged the _Fae Wilds_, a hidden mirror of Eter. With help from Gaia and Miris, she filled it with creatures of whimsy and trickery: pixies, fairies, wood elves, satyrs, and centaurs.
### **1300 BR - The Fall of Karnas**

Born of trickery, Karnas, son of Gaia and Thuros, was a force of chaos. He raised mountains and carved valleys, but his heart burned with fury. Resentful of his origin, he turned against Gaia, unleashing volcanoes, earthquakes, and rivers of molten rock to tear her creation apart.

Immortal through Gaia’s gift, Karnas could not be destroyed by force. The gods despaired—until Serene, ever cunning, devised another path. She seduced Karnas and bore a child: Kael'Zurath, a being of fire and destruction.

In Kael'Zurath’s birth, Karnas’ immortality was unwittingly transferred to the child. Mortal at last, Karnas was brought down by the gods and cast into the chasms he had forged.

But Kael'Zurath lived on. Inheriting his father’s wrath, he ravaged the land, a walking cataclysm. Forests turned to ash, peaks crumbled in his wake.

Gaia, grieving yet resolute, faced her grandson in a battle that shattered the mountains. Wielding the oldest magics of the earth, she bound Kael'Zurath beneath the world, deep within a prison of stone and root, where he remains, dreaming of fire.

### **1200 BR - The Growth of the Pantheon

With Kael'Zurath bound beneath the earth, silence settled over the world. The gods, indifferent to calm but eager for new intrigue, shaped fresh divinities from the cosmic weave, during this time the following gods were born:

- Volos  —  the Eternal Void *(Parents: Velthar & Faelun)*
- Lahna  —  Weather Weaver *(Parents: Thuros & Unara)*
- Darian  —  The Flameforged *(Parents: Thuros & Gaia)*
- Celine  —  of the Harvest Moon *(Parents: Mirin & Gaia)*
- Verion  —  The Reaping Blade *(Parents: Velthar & Celine)*
- Glimerion  —  Force of Progress *(Parents: Darian & Celine)*

Having now formed the final pantheon, and with the founders wanting to preserve their power, they formed an eternal pact not to produce any more gods.
### **1000 BR

In the mortal realm, Glimerion was hard at work to spread the spark of creation and wisdom. He taught the concept of writing and an era of discovery quickly followed. With these new technologies came civilization and thus began the era of growth and the first great empires formed.
