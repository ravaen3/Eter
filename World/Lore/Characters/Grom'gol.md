### Description

Grom'gol was born into chaos and ruin, a time when the orcish tribes of the east were shattered, scattered by internal blood feuds and dragonkin pillagers. From this violent crucible rose a warlord of terrifying charisma and ruthless ambition. His origins are largely unknown, obscured by myth and oral legend. Some claim he was born under a blood moon in the caves of Skarr’tul, raised by coyotes and the desert sun. Others say he was a slave who killed his dragonkin captives and from it created the Gor'kul Clan.

Whatever the truth, by the early 120s, Grom'gol had done the impossible: he unified the feuding eastern orc clans under a single banner. Through a brutal combination of battlefield victories, blood-oaths, and public executions of rival chieftains, he carved out a new orcish dominion stretching across the southern reaches of the Searing Sands. He was crowned warlord by right of conquest, wielding a crude iron crown and a blade forged from stolen steel.

In **127**, sensing weakness in the emerging human order, Grom'gol launched a devastating campaign into the Aden territories. With most of the Adenic legions stationed in the east, his forces swept through the western frontiers unchecked, razing villages and marching on **Edis**, the newly declared capital. The siege of Edis in **129** was among the bloodiest in early Asterian history. Grom'gol’s forces nearly succeeded in taking the city, but were repelled in a final stand led by **Erderius II**, the Chief of the Aden.

Though Grom'gol was driven back, the battle left Erderius II fatally wounded. Grom'gol himself was also wounded during the retreat and is believed to have died later that year, either from his injuries or slain by his own warband for his failure. His body was never recovered, and some orcish legends claim he walked into the mountains alone to die, refusing to fall by another's hand.

Though his campaign ultimately failed, Grom'gol’s legacy endured. Among humans, he became a symbol of orcish savagery and a dark reminder of the dangers beyond the frontier. Among orcs, he was remembered as a great unifier and prophet of vengeance, his banners and war-cries later revived by his son, Gol'khan, during the Second Western Invasion.
