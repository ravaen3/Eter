### Description

Aelrith Greencrown ascended to the throne of Maerendor at the age of thirty-four, following the death of his father, Faelrian Greencrown, known for ushering in an era of peace and natural restoration after the long War of Ashen Vale. Born amidst the towering oaks and whispering groves of Gradlewood, Aelrith was raised in the heart of Maerendor’s ancient seaside capital, Telgareth, under the shadow of his father’s deep-rooted ideals and strong ties to the Old Lore.

Even in youth, Aelrith exhibited the measured calm and thoughtfulness of a scholar-king, favoring diplomacy and stewardship over conquest. When his father passed in 1003, Aelrith inherited a realm stable but fragile, surrounded by watchful allies and quietly shifting threats.

King Varnem Dros of the Mirelands, once a staunch if distant ally of Faelrian Greencrown, grew reclusive and distrustful. In 1024, he began refusing envoys from Maerendor and sealing the borders around the Mirewatch a border-fort controlled by Varnem, citing claims of disease and espionage.

Now, in the year 1025, Aelrith finds his kingdom under growing threat, its ancient treaties unraveling, and the wild heart of Gradlewood stirring with omens. Though still remembered as the **Verdant King**, many wonder if Aelrith will remain a ruler of peace—or become a king of war.
