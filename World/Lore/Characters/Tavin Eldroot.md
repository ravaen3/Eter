### Description

Tavin Eldroot is a well-known if reclusive figure in the Gradlewood region of Maerendor. Once a respected herbalist and apothecary in the capital city of Telgareth, Tavin earned a quiet fame during the waning years of the War of Ashen Vale for treating wounded rangers and wardens who returned from the borderlands. Though he never bore arms himself, his name became synonymous with calm resolve and natural wisdom.

In his later years, Tavin withdrew from court life and took up residence in the trade-village of Aster, nestled along the edge of the Gradlewood’s southern marches. Locals often call him "Old Root" or "the Listening One"—a title he neither denies nor claims.

Tavin is gentle and melancholic, often speaking in riddled proverbs, and seems to carry a quiet burden from his past. He tends a garden of rare swamp herbs and forest mosses, keeps the company of owls, and is known to hum lullabies from the western reaches when he thinks no one hears.

As of 1025, Tavin has grown frail with age, plagued by vivid dreams and strange visions he believes foretell his imminent death. In the twilight of his life, his only desire is to send a final letter—and a family heirloom—to his estranged daughter, **Letha Eldroot**, who he believes still resides in the town of **Biro** beyond the now-sealed swampland border. The closure of Mirewatch and the silence from the south have left him in quiet despair.

Yet some say the forest still listens to him. And that the wind carries his name.
