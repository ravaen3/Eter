### **Description**

Varnem Dros is the reclusive and enigmatic ruler of the Swamplands, sovereign of the **sunken kingdom of Drosmarch**. While once a respected ally of Maerendor under Faelrian Greencrown’s rule, his reign has grown increasingly secretive and strained—especially since the closure of the Mirewatch border fort in 1024.

Under his rule, the Swamplands have turned inward. Trade slowed. Walls were built, and fewer travelers returned from the deep trails. Then came the **Swampplague**, a sickness he claims justifies his isolationist policies. But few in Maerendor believe the plague alone explains his silence.
