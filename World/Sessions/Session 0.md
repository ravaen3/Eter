The Players are starting in a village called Alster, the village is located in Gradlewood, on a connecting path to the Swamplands. Alster is situated within the kingdom of Maerendor, ruled by the king [Aelrith Greencrown](../Lore/Characters/Aelrith%20Greencrown.md), descendent of Faelrian Greencrown III.

Currently there is a sense of fright in the village, as the once flourishing traderoute between Alster and Svalnas has been closed. Causing there to be quite some difficulty crossing into the Swamplands.

According to some, Varnem Dros, the neighboring king, has been coerced by foreign influences and can no longer be trusted as an ally. It was after all his orders that caused the Mirewatch borderfort to start denying entry. Varnem Dros claims that a recent outbreak of Swampplague is the cause for the dramatic shift in policy.

Nether the less, the three adventurers have all found themselves situated in the middle of this political conflict and must now choose their path from their humble beginnings in Alster.

Hopefully they will come to realise that they have a common goal. The only question that remains is, what that goal might be.
