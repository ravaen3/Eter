### Description

Sir Caeldrin Thorne was a sworn knight of the Swamplands, serving with honor under Queen Vilna Dros, during the waning years of the **The Third Orcish Invasion**. Known for his loyalty and sharp instincts, Caeldrin was among the few entrusted to patrol the troubled borderlands south of the Mirewatch Fort.

In 964, he and his company uncovered signs of a deeper threat: members of the elusive **Darkflight,**
a shadowed order thought long dormant, had resurfaced. Caeldrin personally witnessed their abduction of the famed wizard Eldhar, taken under the cover of night into the mountains. Acting without delay, Caeldrin and his companions pursued them, but were swiftly overwhelmed by dark forces beyond their reckoning.

Wounded and separated in the chaos, Caeldrin fled into the Mire, bearing with him the truth of what he had seen. Mortally injured, he succumbed to his wounds in the swamplands. His loyal squire buried him on a small islet, placing his sword beside him and sealing the letter meant for the king within a stone coffer beneath the grave.

The squire, too, would vanish into the mists, his fate lost to time, along with Caeldrinâ€™s final testimony. To the kingdom, Caeldrin died a deserter. But to the land, he remains a silent sentinel, his truth buried with him beneath the roots and reeds of the mire.
