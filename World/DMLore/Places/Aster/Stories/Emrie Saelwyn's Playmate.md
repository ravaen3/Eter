_“She was laughing, that’s what I remember. Just laughing and gone. I looked away and then I was alone.”_
—Mirella Saelwyn, trying to recount that night

### Summary

Several weeks ago, at twilight, **Emrie Saelwyn** followed a trail of **dancing lights** into the Gradlewood. Her mother, Mirella, had only looked away for a moment. **Tavin Eldroot** calls it _spirit-baiting_—a rare and ancient occurrence where **fae lights** appear to lonely or curious souls, luring them into a hidden realm between worlds.

Deep in the forest lies a mossy cave veiled in enchantment, where a **trickster fae spirit**, childlike in mind but ancient in age, now **plays endlessly** with Emrie, overjoyed to have finally found a friend who sees her not as a monster, but as a playmate.

### Act I – Into the Woods

The players are drawn into the mystery by Mirella’s quiet desperation. Tavin confirms that the dancing lights—_spirit-baiting_—haven’t occurred in decades. He believes they lead to an **“overgrown memory,”** a hidden place where the boundary between worlds is thin.

> **Clues in the woods**
> 
> - A ring of mushrooms.
>     
> - Scraps of ribbon or Emrie’s doll caught on thorns.
>     
> - Players may witness **dancing lights** themselves, flitting just ahead.
>     
> - A successful DC 13 Arcana/Nature check identifies the signs as **fae enchantment**.

### Act II – The Cave of the Lonely Spirit

Nestled beneath tangled roots and ivy lies a **mossy, shallow cave**. Inside:

- Flowers bloom where there is no light.
    
- Vines sway as if breathing.
    
- Laughter echoes faintly from unseen corners.
    

**Emrie** is here, laughing and playing among glowing toadstools, building games with leaves and imaginary coins. She’s unharmed, well-fed, and **doesn’t want to leave**.

> **"I told her I could stay forever! She's my best friend now."** —Emrie

### The Fae Spirit

**Name:** _Thyllien_, the Petal-Sister  
**Type:** Chaotic Neutral Fey  
**Appearance:** Shifting form—sometimes a pale child of bark and bloom, other times a swirl of petals with luminous silver eyes.

**Personality:**

- Playful, emotional, and **deeply lonely**.
    
- Speaks in riddles and songs.
    
- Genuinely **loves** Emrie, but doesn’t understand the mortal world’s rules.

### Epilogue Possibilities

- Emrie is returned, but **sleeps restlessly**, still dreaming of Thyllien.
    
- The players later learn the cave has **vanished**, impossible to find again.
    
- If they hurt Thyllien, **strange flowers** bloom in their path for weeks—signs of lingering sorrow or fae attention.
    
- If they **promised to return**, they may one day receive an invitation… or a plea for help.
