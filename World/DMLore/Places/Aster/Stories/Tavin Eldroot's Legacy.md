_"I don’t need saving. I need remembering."_  
—Tavin, holding the sealed letter

### Summary

**Tavin Eldroot** is a retired herbalist and former border warden of Aelrith’s kingdom, now living quietly on the edge of Aster. A widower and father of one, his daughter **Letha** married into a Swamplands family nearly twenty years ago and remains across the now-closed border.

With the recent **sealing of the passes by King Varnem Dros**, letters stopped flowing. No riders, no couriers, no news. And now, as Tavin’s age catches up with him, he's begun to have **dreams of his own death**—soft, spectral visions that smell of smoke and river mud.

Tavin believes the end is near. All he wants now is to get one last letter and a **family heirloom**—an engraved silver ring wrapped in cloth—delivered to Letha, who he believes lives in a riverside village called Biro, quite close to the border crossing.

### Hook: **The Crossing**

Tavin asks the players—kindly, almost humbly—to carry the sealed package **across the sealed border**. He warns them it will not be easy: The Mirewatch Fort has shut the main crossing, and any travelers headed to the Swamplands risk being detained, questioned, or worse.

But he knows a way. A **smuggler’s trail** through the swampwood south of the crossing—"half-sunken and tangled, but still there if you know where to step." He’ll mark it for them on a map.

If the party agrees, they’ll face not only the natural dangers of the fen but also the possibility of being caught by Mirewatch’s patrols—or encountering darker things that stir in the mire.
