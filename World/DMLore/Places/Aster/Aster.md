### The Crooked Antler (Inn & Tavern)

The town’s only inn, **The Crooked Antler**, is a sagging timbered structure built around the partial skeleton of a great stag—its bleached antlers still jutting from above the hearth. The Antler is warm, dim, and always smells of juniper smoke and pine ale. Travelers, forest traders, and the occasional off-duty warden take their meals here.

**Proprietor:** **Brannin Thatch**, a grizzled but kind-eyed ex-woodcutter turned innkeeper. Once a strongman, Brannin’s joints ache with the seasons, and his mind often drifts. He keeps a carefully folded letter tucked in his coat—a farewell he’s never sent to his **estranged family in the Mirelands**, lost to time and distance.

- **Hook:** Brannin seeks someone brave (and discreet) to deliver a letter through **Crookmarsh Gate**, but the border’s been sealed. He believes someone in Aster _knows a forgotten way through the fens._

### Story Hook: [[Emrie Saelwyn's Playmate]]

**Mirella Saelwyn**, a soft-spoken woman who sells herbs and woodcutter’s balm in the market square, has withdrawn from the public eye in recent months. Her **seven-year-old daughter, Emrie**, vanished at dusk six weeks ago near the edge of the Deepwell Grove. No trace was found—only a trail of small handprints in the mud, leading deeper into the woods.

- **Rumors:** Some say it was wolves. Others whisper that Emrie had been speaking to **“a man with silver eyes”** in her dreams.
    
- **Hook:** Mirella offers the last of her coin (and an old family heirloom) to anyone willing to venture into the Deepwell Grove and learn the truth.

### Story Hook: The Old Man on the Hill

**Tavin Eldroot** is a half-blind, white-bearded elder who lives alone in a crumbling cottage on a mossy rise just outside town. Most folk think he’s harmless—just touched in the head. But Tavin was once a **bridge-keeper and messenger** between Maerendor and the Mirelands, long before the gates were sealed.

He claims he’s been **receiving dreams** from someone in his bloodline trapped across the border—perhaps a daughter, perhaps a grandson. Whether delusion or distant calling, he’s become obsessed with building a crude beacon out of driftwood and marshglass on the hilltop, hoping to send a “light through the fog.”

- **Hook:** Tavin begs for help lighting the beacon, but it may draw unwanted attention from the woods… or worse, from watchers beyond the swamp.
